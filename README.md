# Spatial_Data_Analysis
Worked with heavy metal pollution data, sampled from the delta of the Meuse River in Belgium. The values of metal concentrations are sampled at certain spatial points. The spatial sampling is not performed on a close-spaced regular grid. Therefore, spatial interpolation or kriging is used to create a map of the expected concentration of metal pollution.
